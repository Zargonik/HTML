            <h3>Pig</h3>
            <p>A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the even-toed ungulate family Suidae. Pigs include the domestic
                <br> pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along with other species.</p><br>
                <h3>Dog</h3>
                <p>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or<strong> Canis familiaris</strong> when<br><br>
                     considered a distinct species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids,<br></br>
                     and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern 
                     <br> are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of
                     <br> the dog is extinct.</p>
                     <h3>Scrooge McDuck</h3>
                     <p>is a fictional character created in 1947 by Carl Barks during his time as a work-for-hire for The Walt Disney Company.
                         <br> Scrooge is an elderly Scottish anthropomorphic Pekin duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. </p>
                         <p>McDuck was initially characterized as a greedy miser and antihero <mark>(as Charles Dickens&apos; original Scrooge was)</mark>, but in later appearances he
                             <br> has often been portrayed as a charitable and thrifty hero, adventurer and explorer. He was originally created by Barks as an antagonist for
                             <br> Donald Duck, first appearing in the 1947 Four Color story Christmas on Bear Mountain. However,<a href="task from Vova.html">McDuck&apos;</a>s popularity grew so large that
                             <br> he became a major figure of the Duck universe. In 1952 he was given his own comic book series, called Uncle Scrooge, which still runs today.</p>
