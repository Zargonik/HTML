                    A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the even-toed ungulate 
                    family Suidae. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common 
                    Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along with other species.

                <dd>
                    The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of 
                    the wolf or <strong>Canis familiaris</strong> when considered a distinct species)
                     is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like 
                     canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.The dog and the 
                     extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the 
                     wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of 
                     the dog is extinct.

                <dd>
                        is a fictional character created in 1947 by Carl Barks during his time as a 
                        work-for-hire for The Walt Disney Company. Scrooge is an elderly Scottish 
                        anthropomorphic Pekin duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet.

                    McDuck was initially characterized as a greedy miser and antihero 
                    <mark>(as Charles Dickens&apos; original Scrooge was)</mark>, but in later appearances he 
                    has often been portrayed as a charitable and thrifty hero, adventurer and 
                    explorer. He was originally created by Barks as an antagonist for <del>Donald Duck</del>, 
                    first appearing in the 1947 Four Color story Christmas on Bear Mountain. However, 
                    <a href="/">McDuck&apos;</a> popularity grew so large that he became a major figure of the Duck 
                    universe. In 1952 he was given his own comic book series, called Uncle Scrooge, 
                    which still runs today.
