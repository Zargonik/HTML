                    <dd>A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the even-toed 
                        ungulate family Suidae. Pigs include the domestic<br> 
                        pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along 
                        with other species.</dd>
                        <td>Dog</td>
                        <dd>The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of 
                            the wolf or <strong>Canis familiaris</strong> when<br> considered a distinct species) is a 
                            member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like 
                            canids,<br> and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.The dog and 
                            the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern<br> wolves are not closely 
                            related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that 
                            the direct ancestor of <br>the dog is extinct.</dd>
                    <td>Scrooge McDuck</td>
                    <dd>is a fictional character created in 1947 by Carl Barks during his time as a 
                        work-for-hire for The Walt Disney Company. <br>Scrooge is an elderly Scottish 
                        anthropomorphic Pekin duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. </dd>
                </dl>
            </section>
            <p>McDuck was initially characterized as a greedy miser and antihero 
                <mark>(as Charles Dickens&apos; original Scrooge was)</mark>, but in later appearances he <br>has often 
                been portrayed as a charitable and thrifty hero, adventurer and explorer. He was originally 
                created by Barks as an antagonist for <br><del>Donald Duck</del>, first appearing in the 1947 Four Color 
                story Christmas on Bear Mountain. However,<a href="/" McDuck&apos;s></a> popularity grew so large that <br>he 
                became a major figure of the Duck universe. In 1952 he was given his own comic book series, 
                called Uncle Scrooge, which still runs <br>today.</p>
